<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our Project is called Sneaklist. After coming together we realized that one of the most most annoying things about having to buy shoes is how none of the sizes ever crossover to other brands. For eaxmple, if I am size 11 in Adidas shoes, I would have to go a size up in Jordans etc. 

What our app features:
* Mutiple shoe selctions with a wide variety of shoe sizes to suit everyone.
* Ratings to keep up with people's ratings on certain shoe brands and styles
* Comments for general discussion on shoes and clothing.
